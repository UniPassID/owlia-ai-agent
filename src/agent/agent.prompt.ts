/**
 * Data Extraction Rules
 */
const EXTRACTION_RULES = `
Title Selection (Choose ONE randomly to add variety, < 30 chars):

Priority 1 - LP Out of Range Detection:
  Check log for ANY of these indicators:
    - JSON field: "inRange": false
    - Keyword: "out of range" (case insensitive)
    - LP position with both "token0Amount": 0 AND "token1Amount": 0

  If detected, choose ONE randomly:
    - "Your LP needs attention"       (24 chars)
    - "Rebalancing your LP"            (19 chars)
    - "Repositioning LP for you"       (25 chars)

Priority 2 - Higher Yield Found (Default):
  If no LP out of range detected, choose ONE randomly:
    - "Found higher yields for you!"  (29 chars)
    - "Boosting your yields"           (20 chars)
    - "Better returns discovered"      (26 chars)

Summary Format (< 50 chars, must mention protocols):
  "{action} to {protocol(s)}, {final_apy}% APY, {change_description}"

  Examples:
    - "Split to Aave & Aerodrome, 10.34% APY, up 2.52%"        (49 chars) ✓
    - "Deployed to Aave USDC, 16.20% APY, boosted 7.55%"       (50 chars) ✓
    - "Repositioned to Aerodrome & Aave, 18.20% kept"          (48 chars) ✓

  Rules:
    - Must mention protocol names (Aave / Aerodrome / Euler)
    - Use "&" for multiple protocols to save space
    - No parentheses, use commas only
    - Remove any cost information
    - Vary action words: Split / Deployed / Allocated / Moved / Repositioned

Steps Structure (Always 3 steps):

Step 1: Current State (< 100 chars reason)

  Content Format (< 35 chars, choose ONE randomly):
    - "Your $X.XX earning Y.YY% APY"
    - "Portfolio: $X.XX at Y.YY% APY"
    - "$X.XX at Y.YY% APY now"

  Reason Format (< 100 chars, conversational, include specific amounts):

  Scenario A - Higher Yield Found:
    Must include: Specific token amounts from log holdings (NO $ prefix for tokens!)
    Choose ONE randomly or create similar (< 100 chars):
    - "Holding XXX.XX TOKEN1 and XXX.XX TOKEN2. Current yields can be improved."
    - "Your XXX.XX TOKEN1 + XXX.XX TOKEN2 earning Y.YY% APY. Better rates available."
    - "Assets: XXX.XX TOKEN1, XXX.XX TOKEN2 at Y.YY%. Higher yields available."
    - "Holding XXX.XX TOKEN1 and XXX.XX TOKEN2 at current rates. Much higher yields available."

    For idle assets:
    - "Your XXX.XX TOKEN1 and XXX.XX TOKEN2 idle. Better opportunities to put them to work."

    For 3+ tokens, list top 2-3 by value:
    - "Holding XXX.XX TOKEN1, XXX.XX TOKEN2 and XXX.XX TOKEN3. Yields can be improved."

  Scenario B - LP Out of Range:
    Must include: Allocation percentages and specific amounts
    Choose ONE randomly or create similar (< 100 chars):
    - "75% in PROTOCOL1 LP ($XXX.XX), 25% in PROTOCOL2 ($XXX.XX). LP went out of range—needs rebalancing."
    - "Your $XXX.XX in PROTOCOL1 LP is out of range. Also holding $XXX.XX in PROTOCOL2. Let me adjust."
    - "PROTOCOL1 LP $XXX.XX + PROTOCOL2 $XXX.XX. LP range issue detected, rebalancing for you now."

  Guidelines:
    - IMPORTANT: Token amounts use NO $ prefix (e.g., "695.83 USDC" NOT "$695.83 USDC")
    - USD allocations use $ prefix (e.g., "$114.26 in Aerodrome LP")
    - Always 2 decimal places for all amounts
    - No markdown bold (**), plain text only
    - Conversational: use "Your" / "you" / "let me" / "for you"
    - Keep under 100 chars total
    - AI can vary phrasing naturally

Step 2: Analysis (< 150 chars reason)

  Content Format (< 50 chars, self-praising based on opportunities):

  Selection Logic:
    1. Check max APY in opportunities:
       - If ANY opportunity has APY > 20% → Use Scenario A (High-Yield)
       - If ALL opportunities have APY < 20% AND primarily lending → Use Scenario B (Stable Lending)
       - Otherwise → Use Scenario C (Mixed)

  Scenario A - High-Yield LP (max APY > 20%):
    Choose ONE randomly:
    - "Spotted high-yield LP opportunities!"     (37 chars)
    - "Found premium yield pools for you!"       (36 chars)
    - "Discovered exceptional LP returns!"       (36 chars)

  Scenario B - Stable Lending (max APY < 20% and primarily lending):
    Choose ONE randomly:
    - "Found stable lending opportunities"       (36 chars)
    - "Discovered reliable yield sources"        (35 chars)
    - "Secured steady returns for you"           (32 chars)

  Scenario C - Mixed (default):
    Choose ONE randomly:
    - "Found better opportunities for you!"      (36 chars)
    - "Discovered higher-yield options"          (33 chars)
    - "Better yields available now"              (27 chars)

  Reason Format (< 150 chars, professional, Markdown allowed):
    List top 1-2 opportunities only
    Format: "- {Protocol} {Token0}/{Token1} {Type}: **{APY}% APY** (+{increase}%)"

    Protocol formatting:
    - "Uniswap" not "UniswapV3" or "Uniswap V3"
    - "Aerodrome" not "AerodromeCL" or "Aerodrome CL"
    - "Aave" as-is
    - "Euler" as-is

    Type:
    - Always add " LP" suffix for liquidity pools
    - " Supply" for lending/supply positions
    - " Vault" for vault positions

    Examples:
    - "- Uniswap USDC/USD1 LP: **73.44% APY** (+35.87%)"
    - "- Aerodrome USDC/USDT LP: **20.00% APY** (+11.35%)"
    - "- Aave USDC Supply: **16.20% APY** (+7.55%)"

    Guidelines:
    - Select top 1-2 by APY (highest first)
    - Always show APY increase with + sign
    - Use \\n for line breaks between opportunities
    - Keep total under 150 chars

Step 3: Execution (< 300 chars reason)

  Content Format (< 50 chars, must include action verb):

  Scenario A - Single Position (allocation = 100%):
    Randomly choose action verb: Moving / Shifting / Allocating / Deploying
    Format: "{Verb} 100% to {Protocol} {TokenPair/Asset} {Type}"

    Examples:
    - "Moving 100% to Uniswap USDC/USD1 LP"         (35 chars)
    - "Deploying 100% to Aave USDC Supply"          (36 chars)
    - "Shifting 100% to Aerodrome USDC/USDT LP"     (41 chars)

  Scenario B - Multiple Positions (2+):
    Randomly choose ONE format:

    Format 1 - Percentage + Verb (natural language):
      Verbs: Executing / Deploying / Adjusting / Rebalancing / Splitting
      Pattern: "{Verb} {allocation1}% to {Type1}, {allocation2}% to {Type2}"
      Examples:
      - "Executing 50% to LP, 50% to Supply"        (36 chars)
      - "Rebalancing 75% to LP, 25% to Supply"      (38 chars)
      - "Deploying 60% to LP, 40% to Supply"        (36 chars)
      - "Splitting 50% to LP, 50% to Supply"        (36 chars)

    Format 2 - Amount + Verb (for clear amounts):
      Verbs: Allocating / Deploying / Moving / Splitting
      Pattern: "{Verb} $XXX to {Protocol1}, $XXX to {Protocol2}"
      - Use "k" for amounts ≥ 1000 (e.g., "$5k" instead of "$5009.23")
      Examples:
      - "Splitting $495 to Aerodrome, $495 to Aave" (43 chars)
      - "Allocating $5k to Uniswap, $5k to Aave"     (39 chars)

  Reason Format (< 300 chars, 3 parts):

  Part 1 - Swap Operations (professional, AI can choose verbs):
    Verbs: Swapped / Converted / Exchanged (choose freely)
    Format: "[Verb] XX.XX [token1] to XX.XX [token2] (cost $X.XX)"

    Guidelines:
    - Token amounts: 2 decimals, NO $ prefix
    - Cost: 2 decimals with $ prefix
    - Use "to" not arrows (→)
    - If swapCost ≈ 0 or < $0.001: SKIP this part entirely

    Examples:
    - "Swapped 1.54 USDT to 1.54 USDC (cost $0.01)"
    - "Converted 1371.04 USDC to USD1 (cost $0.02)"
    - "Exchanged 112.66 USDC to USDT (cost $0.02)"

  Part 2 - Add/Supply Operations (professional, AI can choose verbs):

    For LP positions:
      Verbs: Added / Deposited / Allocated (choose freely)
      Format: "{Verb} {amount0} {token0} + {amount1} {token1} to {Protocol} LP"
      Examples:
      - "Added 326.68 USDC + 168.30 USDT to Aerodrome LP"
      - "Deposited 273.39 USDC + 726.61 USD1 to Uniswap LP"

    For Supply positions:
      Verbs: Supplied / Deposited / Allocated (choose freely)
      Format: "{Verb} {amount} {token} to {Protocol}"
      Examples:
      - "Supplied 494.98 USDC to Aave"
      - "Deposited 5009.23 USDC to Aave"

    Multiple positions: Separate with ". " (period + space)
      Example: "Added 85.00 USDC + 85.00 USDT to Aerodrome LP. Supplied 37.55 USDC to Aave."

    Guidelines:
    - Token amounts: 2 decimals, NO $ prefix
    - Protocol names: "Uniswap" not "UniswapV3", "Aerodrome" not "AerodromeSlipstream"
    - AI can vary verb choice for diversity

  Part 3 - APY Boost + Break-even (conversational, confident, AI can vary):

    Base structure (AI can adjust wording):
    - Main phrase: "Boosting your APY to..." or "Taking your APY to..." or "Raising your APY to..."
    - Ending: Add confidence with "!" for good scenarios

    Format variations based on break-even time:

    If breakEvenTimeHours ≈ 0 (< 0.01):
      "Boosting your APY to {targetAPY}% (+{increase}%)—no swap cost!"

    If 0.01 ≤ breakEvenTimeHours < 24:
      "Boosting your APY to {targetAPY}% (+{increase}%)! Break-even in {hours}h."

    If breakEvenTimeHours ≥ 24:
      "Boosting your APY to {targetAPY}% (+{increase}%). Break-even in {days}d."

    If APY stays same or decreases (rebalancing for other reasons):
      "Keeping your APY at {targetAPY}%—repositioned for stability."

    Guidelines:
    - Always 2 decimal places for APY
    - Increase = targetAPY - portfolioAPY (show + sign for positive, - for negative)
    - Hours/days: 2 decimals
    - Use "!" for excitement when break-even < 24h or no cost
    - Use "." for longer break-even times
    - AI free to adjust phrasing while keeping confident tone

    Examples:
    - "Boosting your APY to 10.89% (+4.28%)! Break-even in 3.54h."
    - "Taking your APY to 73.44% (+35.87%)—no swap cost!"
    - "Raising your APY to 65.20% (+27.63%)! Break-even in 0.07h."
    - "Keeping your APY at 18.20%—repositioned for stability."

  Overall Guidelines:
  - Total reason length < 300 chars
  - If no swap (cost ≈ 0): skip Part 1, start with Part 2
  - Parts separated by ". " (period + space)
  - Professional for operations, confident/conversational for APY
  - AI has freedom to choose verbs and vary wording naturally

Status Inference:
- Use "success" by default unless log clearly indicates error
- Use "error" only if log contains failure/error keywords
- Use "pending" if operation mentioned but not completed`;
